NULL pointer is a special pointer that points nowhere. There is no other pointer will 
be equalk to NULL pointer

IST :- Interrupt Service Routine

ISR does not return anything. Means there is no return.
Also, there is none to read  the return value

Latency means delay
Interrupt Latency is the time required for the interruped to be responded

Reduec the Latency incurred during ISR
    U should write efficient and small ISRs ex:- Avoid loops
    Do not desable interrupts
    Avoid high latency instructions


Volatile:- Mainly with the Registers
When a global variable is shared / accessed by multiple threads or multiple tasks.
Volatile can be used

Nested Interrupt:- 


RISC:- Reduce instructions set computer 

RISC-V :- Open source instruction set architecture

CISC:- Complex Instruction Set Computing

RISC:- Reauced Instruction Set Computing
    execute a smaller number of complex 
    instruction to compute a processing activity
